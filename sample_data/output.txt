	summary: "Alan Turing was a British mathematician, computer scientist, and logician who made significant contributions to the development of theoretical computer science, cryptography, and artificial intelligence. He is widely considered the father of theoretical computer science and played a crucial role in cracking German ciphers during World War II. Turing's legacy extends beyond his scientific achievements, as he was a pioneer for LGBTQ+ rights and was posthumously pardoned for his conviction under historical legislation."
